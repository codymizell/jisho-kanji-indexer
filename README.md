# jisho-kanji-indexer
A browser extension for https://jisho.org/ that, among other things, allows users to specify their preferred kanji dictionary, and adds that dictionary's index of all the kanji to their respective pages.

## features
- Specify your preferred kanji dictionary to pull indices from.
- Displays the index with the kanji's details, underneath the stroke, radicals, and parts
- Replaces the image of the kanji that is displayed on it's page with the stroke video that is normally below it

## todo list
- Fix preference support
    > I did not realize initially that not all dictionaries were available for every kanji on the website, so the current preference system does not work. It will currently just select the first dictionary that appears on the list
- Clean/Refactor Code
    > This is just a rough proof of concept, the code is pretty messy and I need to refactor it a bit.
